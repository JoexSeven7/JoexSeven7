## Hi there 👋

I’m a Software Developer currently pursuing my [Bachelor’s degree in Software Development at BYU–Idaho](https://byupw.instructure.com/). I work at Cecure Intelligence Limited, building real-world applications and sharpening my skills every day.

I love turning ideas into working products clean interfaces, solid logic, and systems that actually help people. Right now, I’m also building a startup called Oil7, learning entrepreneurship alongside development.

I believe in steady growth, creativity, and building things that matter.
